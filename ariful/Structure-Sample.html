        <P>Employees, staff, clients, deliverymen, couriers... these
            days, it's hard to keep track of people on your premises.
            Security guards do their best to check records and
            credentials, but there's always a chance of a security
            breach. With so many people coming and going, restricted
            areas can be easily accessed, important documents and
            material copied and goods and expensive equipment can be
            stolen. What's more, guards and people can even be bribed
            to let an unauthorised person enter.</p>

        <p>To make matters worse, shift duties add to the confusion.
            And valuable man-hours are spent on registers, records and
            overall attendance.</p>

        <p>The need of the hour is a system that grants access to only
            authorised personnel. A system that's intelligent enough to
            differentiate one employee from the other, add layers of
            access control and even track and monitor attendance.</p>

        <p>Ceasefire brings you just a system – the Ceasefire Access
            Control System, the most advanced in the country.</P>

        <h3>Why Ceasefire Access Control</h3>
    </header>
    <article>
        <p>At Ceasefire, we believe in looking into the future and being
            in control. Looking every threat in the eye and producing a
            weapon so powerful and advanced, it wipes out every trace
            of danger. Because we believe that if nothing is left to
            chance, nothing can possibly go wrong.</p>

        <p>Which is why we’ve designed the Ceasefire Access Control
            System - a system that allows you full control.
            Produced to our exacting standards in terms of quality,
            design and performance, in some of the world’s leading
            manufacturing facilities, this top-of-the-line range is a system
            like no other. </p>

        <p>It’s designed to present trespassers with complex layers of
            security they haven’t even heard of, much less experienced.
            From password and PIN protected doors to biometric ID
            restricted areas, the Access Control System guarantees
            complete protection. In other words, it chooses who can
            gain access and who can’t, while performing all the duties of
            a time-keeper, attendance monitor and salary manager. It
            records, tracks and reports 24x7.</p>

        <h3>How the Ceasefire Access Control System works.</h3>
    </header>
    <article>
        <div>
            <p>An access control point can be a door, turnstile, parking
                gate, elevator, or other physical barrier where granting
                access can be electronically controlled.</p>

            <p>Access control can contain several elements. At its most
                basic, is a standalone electric lock, which is unlocked by an
                operator with a switch. To automate this, operator
                intervention is replaced by a reader. Readers could be a
                keypad where a code is entered, a card reader, or a
                biometric reader. Readers then send the card number to
                an access control panel that verifies the number against an
                access list.</p>

            <p>To monitor the door position, magnetic door switches are
                used. Generally only entry is controlled. In cases where the
                exit is also controlled, a second reader is installed on the
                other side of the door. In cases where exit is not controlled,
                a device called request-to- exit (RTE) is used.
                Request-to-exit devices can be a push-button or a motion
                detector. When the button is pushed or the motion detector
                detects motion at the door, the door alarm is temporarily
                ignored while the door is opened.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>All access door hardware is connected directly
                to intelligent or semi-intelligent readers. Readers usually do
                not make access decisions, and forward all requests to the
                main controller.</p>

            <p>Only in the event that the connection to the main controller is
                unavailable, the readers use their internal database to make
                access decisions and record events. Semi-intelligent readers
                that have no database and cannot function without the main
                controller should be used only in areas that do not require
                high security. Main controllers usually support 16 to 64
                readers.</p>

            <p>The Ceasefire Access Control System also makes for the
                perfect attendance record-keeper. Loaded with face
                recognition, access card entry and supreme SFM fingerprint
                modules designed to provide biometric security, the
                Ceasefire Access Control System gives a powerful
                verification performance that wipes out the possibility for any
                proxy attendances. Also, with its easy integration with various
                other external databases, other functions like work-hour
                calculation and salary calculation become an easy task.</p>
